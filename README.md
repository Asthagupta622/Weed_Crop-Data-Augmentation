# Overview
The WeedCrop Data Augmentation project aims to enhance the diversity and quantity of weed and crop images to improve the performance of machine learning models for weed detection in agricultural settings. By applying various augmentation techniques, we generate synthetic data that can be used to train and improve the robustness of models designed to differentiate between weeds and crops in farming environments.

# Features
Data Augmentation Techniques: The project utilizes several augmentation methods, such as rotation, flipping, cropping, scaling, and color adjustments, to create diverse image variations.
Dataset Enhancement: The project works on a labeled dataset of weed and crop images, creating synthetic data for underrepresented classes or conditions.
Model Training: The augmented data can be used to train deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for weed detection in agricultural applications.
Performance Improvement: Augmenting the dataset helps in overcoming the limitations of small or imbalanced datasets, leading to more robust and accurate machine learning models.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images containing both weed and crop plants. It includes images with various environmental conditions, lighting, and backgrounds, which may be augmented further to ensure a diverse range of data for training.

If you have access to a similar dataset or would like to use this project on your own dataset, feel free to adapt the augmentation methods.

# Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Required libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Albumentations (optional, for more advanced augmentations)
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib albumentations
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/Asthagupta622/weedcrop-data-augmentation.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash

cd weedcrop-data-augmentation
Place your dataset (weed and crop images) in the data/ directory.

Run the augmentation script:


This will apply various augmentation techniques to the images in your dataset and save the augmented images in the augmented_data/ directory.

# Augmentation Techniques
Rotation: Random rotation of images within a specified range.
Flipping: Horizontal and vertical flipping of images.
Cropping: Random cropping of images to simulate zoom effects.
Scaling: Random scaling of images to simulate changes in size.
Color Adjustments: Random modifications to the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the images.

# Example of Augmented Image
Original Image	Augmented Image
Training with Augmented Data
Once the dataset has been augmented, the next step is to use the augmented data for training a machine learning model. The augmented data is automatically saved into the directory and can be fed into a training pipeline for model improvement.
